## Jets Project

### Overview

This is the Week 3 assignment for the Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp that further expands and builds upon earlier OOP concepts.  This project allows a user to manipulate data for different jet classes in an array, created from an external .txt file.

### How to Run

  1.  This Project is accompanied by "jets.txt" which provides all initial plane data.  While User will have the ability to add jets within the program (see below), the text file may be amended prior to executing the program.  Should User wish to amend "jets.txt" prior to execution, they may do so by adding the following data in order:
  * Class (Jet, CargoJet, FighterJet, BomberJet, AerialFireFighter)
  * Model
  * Speed (MPH)
  * Range (Miles)
  * Cost (USD)

  2.  Compile and/or run this Project in a compatible IDE or Java Runtime Environment of your choice.  This Project was programmed and compiled in Eclipse under Java SE 8 [1.8.0_261].

  3.  Program will automatically load the data and send User to a menu.  The menu will allow User to choose from a series of options regarding this data.  User will be able to review the master list of jets, determine the jet with the fastest speed and longest range, make all jets fly, and activate any jet's specialized task(s).

  4.  User has the option to add/remove jets to/from the array.  Should User wish to add a jet, they will be prompted to enter the model, speed, range, and cost of the jet the wish to include. Should User wish to remove a jet, they will be given a list of the jets and an option to choose a number for the corresponding jet they wish to remove.

  When User has finished using the program, they may exit by choosing option 11 on the menu.

  5.  Have fun!
